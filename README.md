# MyOwnRESTapi
I have created my own restful API using postman,robo3t(mongodb),nodejs and created it which can perform functions like creating database,reading from database,storing documents in 
database,updating documents in database and even updating a specific database,deleting the documents from the database,etc. I have used CRUD,GET,PUT,PATCH,UPDATE,DELETE functions.
